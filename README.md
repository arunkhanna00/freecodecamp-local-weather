# Show the Local Weather
Make an application to show the local weather using Open Weather API

[Click here](https://arunkhanna00.github.io/freecodecamp-local-weather/) to go to the app 

Make sure that you click on the 'shield' icon in the top-right corner of the address bar and select 'Load Unsafe Scripts' to run (this is because the API runs using HTTP and not HTTPS)

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and open index.html from the /dist/ folder

The web application should look like this and update according to your location
